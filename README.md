### Maybe

A little personal hands-on learning with Golang, this performs the following tasks:
- Opens an HTTP API that can insert and find articles.
- Opens a connection with MongoDB and perform the required operations.
- Also tests dotenv in the language.

Overall, the language is pretty cool with a few quirks:
- Struct tags are not the most fun to remember.
- Lowercase errors, although I understand the point.
- Anonymous structures feels weird.
